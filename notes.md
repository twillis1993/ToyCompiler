# TODO

Check coursework brief, needs to be able to evaluate expressions

Need if statement to check equality

Reintroduce augmented assignment

Reintroduce read/write statements

Use the %left operator to introduce precedence

# Pseudocode

while a != b
	if a > b
		a := a - b;
	else
		b := b - a;
return a;

# AST

I think that the Expression: Factor production may pose a problem as it will give us an IntegerNode Expression
